Thought-capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity,
[23] and have been common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or
Karel Čapek's R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots). These characters and their
fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial
intelligence.

The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and
mathematicians in antiquity. The study of mathematical logic led directly
to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine,
by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable
act of mathematical deduction.
This insight, that digital computers can simulate any process of formal
reasoning, is known as the Church–Turing thesis. Along with concurrent
discoveries in neurobiology, information theory and cybernetics, this led
researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain.
Turing proposed that "if a human could not distinguish between responses
from a machine and a human, the machine could be considered “intelligent".
 The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was McCullouch and
 Pitts' 1943 formal design for Turing-complete "artificial neurons".
